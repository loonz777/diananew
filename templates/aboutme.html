	Perhaps as a result of the loneliness of those first months in London, the young singer decided to unleash an incredible explosion of creativity that was housed inside her, a decision that would change her life forever. Camera in hand, and by her own financial means, she created a video blog, hosted on her own YouTube channel, ‘JustDlady’, achieving more than one hundred thousand subscribers in just a few months.

	Since childhood, Diana has lived immersed in an atmosphere of creativity that has predisposed her toward artistic expression, with her main points of reference coming from her maternal family. At just five years old, every time she visited her grandmother she performed and sang to the neighbors, surprising everyone with her sweetness, beauty and angelic voice.  It is at that early age that she also began to play the piano. She does not fondly recall her school years, with peers marginalizing her, seeing the talents that lay within her as something that made her different from others. But her marked personality and strong character allowed her to overcome the difficulties of her youth, with Diana not only becoming school president, but also beginning to prepare herself thoroughly for what, years later, would become a promising career in the music industry. Diana combined her studies with dance and music classes, taking every opportunity and proving herself to be the antithesis of uniformity.
